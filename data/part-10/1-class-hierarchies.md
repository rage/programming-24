## Special classes for special purposes

Sometimes you come across a situation where you have already defined a class, but then realize you need special traits in some, but not all, instances of the class. Then again, sometimes you realize you've defined two very similar classes with only minor differences. As programmers we aim to always repeat ourselves as little as possible, while maintaining clarity and readability. So how can we accommodate for different implementations of intrinsically similar objects?

Let's have a look at two class definitions: `Student` and `Teacher`. Getter and setter methods have been left out for now, in order to keep the example short.

```python

class Student:

    def __init__(self, name: str, id: str, email: str, credits: str):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id
        self.email = email
        self.credits = credits

class Teacher:

    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str, room: str, teaching_years: int):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.room = room
        self.teaching_years = teaching_years

```

Even in a stripped down example, like the above, we already have quite a bit of repetition: both classes contain attributes `name` and `email`. It would be a good idea to have a single attribute definition, so that a single function would suffice for editing both attributes. 

For example, imagine the school's email address changed. All addresses would have to be updated. We _could_ write two separate versions of essentially the same function:

```python

def update_email(o: Student):
    o.email = o.email.replace(".com", ".edu")

def update_email2(o: Teacher):
    o.email = o.email.replace(".com", ".edu")

```

Writing practically the same thing twice is unnecessary repetition, not to mention it doubles the possibilities for errors. It would be a definite improvement if we could use a single function to work with instances of both classes.

Both classes also have attributes which are unique to them. Simply combining _all_ attributes in a single class would mean _all_ instances of the class would then have unnecessary attributes, just different ones for different instances. That doesn't seem like an ideal situation, either.

 ## Inheritance

Object oriented programming languages usually feature a technique called _inheritance_. A class can _inherit_ the traits of another class. In addition to these inherited traits a class can also contain traits which are unique to it.

Knowing this, it would make sense for the `Teacher` and `Student` classes to have a common base or parent class `Person`:

 ```python

class Person:

    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

 ```

The new class contains those traits which are shared by the other two classes. Now `Student` and `Teacher` can _inherit_ these traits and add their own besides.

The syntax for inheritance simply involves adding the base class name in parentheses on the header line:

 ```python
class Person:

    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email

    def update_email_domain(self, new_domain: str):
        old_domain = self.email.split("@")[1]
        self.email = self.email.replace(old_domain, new_domain)


class Student(Person):

    def __init__(self, name: str, id: str, email: str, credits: str):
        self.name = name
        self.id = id
        self.email = email
        self.credits = credits


class Teacher(Person):

    def __init__(self, name: str, email: str, room: str, teaching_years: int):
        self.name = name
        self.email = email
        self.room = room
        self.teaching_years = teaching_years

# Let's test our classes
if __name__ == "__main__":
    saul = Student("Saul Student", "1234", "saul@example.com", 0)
    saul.update_email_domain("example.edu")
    print(saul.email)

    tara = Teacher("Tara Teacher", "tara@example.fi", "A123", 2)
    tara.update_email_domain("example.ex")
    print(tara.email)

 ```

Both `Student` and `Teacher` inherit the `Person` class, so both have the traits defined in the `Person` class, including the method `update_email_domain`. The same method works for instances of both the derived classes.

Let's have a look at another example. We have a `Bookshelf` which inherits the class `BookContainer`:

 ```python
class Book:
    """ This class models a simple book """
    def __init__(self, name: str, author: str):
        self.name = name
        self.author = author


class BookContainer:
    """ This class models a container for books """

    def __init__(self):
        self.books = []

    def add_book(self, book: Book):
        self.books.append(book)

    def list_books(self):
        for book in self.books:
            print(f"{book.name} ({book.author})")


class Bookshelf(BookContainer):
    """ This class models a shelf for books """

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def add_book(self, book: Book, location: int):
        self.books.insert(location, book)

 ```

The class `Bookshelf` contains the method `add_book`. A method with the same name is defined in the base class  `BookContainer`. This is called _overriding_: if a derived class has a method with the same name as the base class, the derived version overrides the original in instances of the derived class.

The idea in the example above is that a new book added to a BookContainer always goes to the top, but with a Bookshelf you can specify the location yourself. The method `list_books` works the same for both classes, as there is no overriding method in the derived class.

Let's try out these classes:

 ```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create some books for testing
    b1 = Book("Old Man and the Sea", "Ernest Hemingway")
    b2 = Book("Silent Spring", "Rachel Carson")
    b3 = Book("Pride and Prejudice", "Jane Austen")

    # Create a BookContainer and add the books
    container = BookContainer()
    container.add_book(b1)
    container.add_book(b2)
    container.add_book(b3)

    # Create a Bookshelf and add the books (always to the beginning)
    shelf = Bookshelf()
    shelf.add_book(b1, 0)
    shelf.add_book(b2, 0)
    shelf.add_book(b3, 0)


    # Tulostetaan
    print("Container:")
    container.list_books()

    print()

    print("Shelf:")
    shelf.list_books()
 ```

 <sample-output>

Container:
Old Man and the Sea (Ernest Hemingway)
Silent Spring (Rachel Carson)
Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen)

Shelf:
Pride and Prejudice (Jane Austen)
Silent Spring (Rachel Carson)
Old Man and the Sea (Ernest Hemingway)

 </sample-output>

So, the Bookshelf class also has access to the `list_books` method. Through inheritance the method is a member of all the classes derived from the `BookContainer` class.

 ## Inheritance and scope of traits

A derived class inherits all traits from its base class. Those traits are directly accessible in the derived class, unless they have been defined as private in the base class (with two underscores before the name of the trait).

As the attributes of a Bookshelf are identical to a BookContainer, there was no need to rewrite the constructor of Bookshelf. We simply called the constructor of the base class:

 ```python
class Bookshelf(BookContainer):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

```

Any trait in the base class can be accessed from the derived class with the function `super()`. The `self` argument is left out from the method call, as Python adds it automatically.

But what if the attributes are not identical; can we still use the base class constructor in some way? Let's have a look at a class named `Thesis` which inherits the `Book` class. The derived class _can_ still call the constructor from the base class:

```python

class Book:
    """ This class models a simple book """

    def __init__(self, name: str, author: str):
        self.name = name
        self.author = author


class Thesis(Book):
    """ This class models a graduate thesis """

    def __init__(self, name: str, author: str, grade: int):
        super().__init__(name, author)
        self.grade = grade

```

The constructor in the `Thesis` class calls the constructor in the base class `Book` with the arguments for `name` and `author`. Additionally, the constructor in the derived class sets the value for the attribute `grade`. This naturally cannot be a part of the base class constructor, as the base class has no such attribute.

The above class can be used like this:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    thesis = Thesis("Python and the Universe", "Peter Pythons", 3)

    # Print out the values of the attributes
    print(thesis.name)
    print(thesis.author)
    print(thesis.grade)

```

<sample-output>

Python and the Universe
Peter Pythons
3

</sample-output>

Even if a derived class _overrides_ a method in its base class, the derived class can _still_ call the overridden method in the base class. In the following example we have a basic `BonusCard` and a special `PlatinumCard` for especially loyal customers. The `calculate_bonus` method is overridden in the derived class, but the overriding method calls the base method:

```python

class Product:

    def __init__(self, name: str, price: float):
        self.name = name
        self.price = price

class BonusCard:

    def __init__(self):
        self.products_bought = []

    def add_product(self, product: Product):
        self.products_bought.append(product)

    def calculate_bonus(self):
        bonus = 0
        for product in self.products_bought:
            bonus += product.price * 0.05

        return bonus

class PlatinumCard(BonusCard):

    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()

    def calculate_bonus(self):
        # Call the method in the base class
        bonus = super().calculate_bonus()

        # ...and add five percent to the total
        bonus = bonus * 1.05
        return bonus
```

So, the bonus for a PlatinumCard is calculated by calling the overridden method in the base class, and then adding an extra 5 percent to the base result. An example of how these classes are used:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    card = BonusCard()
    card.add_product(Product("Bananas", 6.50))
    card.add_product(Product("Satsumas", 7.95))
    bonus = card.calculate_bonus()

    card2 = PlatinumCard()
    card2.add_product(Product("Bananas", 6.50))
    card2.add_product(Product("Satsumas", 7.95))
    bonus2 = card2.calculate_bonus()

    print(bonus)
    print(bonus2)
```

<programming-exercise name='Laptop computer' tmcname='part10-01_laptop_computer'>

The exercise template contains a class definition for a `Computer`, which has the attributes `model` and `speed`.

Please define a class named `LaptopComputer` which _inherits_ the class `Computer`. The constructor of the new class should take a third argument: `weight`, of type integer.

Please also include a `__str__` method in your class definition. See the example below for the expected format of the string representation printed out.

```python
laptop = LaptopComputer("NoteBook Pro15", 1500, 2)
print(laptop)
```

<sample-output>

NoteBook Pro15, 1500 MHz, 2 kg

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

<programming-exercise name='Game Museum' tmcname='part10-02_game_museum'>

The exercise template contains class definitions for a `ComputerGame` and a `GameWarehouse`. A GameWarehouse object is used to store ComputerGame objects.

Please familiarize yourself with these classes. Then define a new class named `GameMuseum` which inherits the `GameWarehouse` class.

The GameMuseum class should _override_ the `list_games()` method, so that it returns a list of only those games which were made before the year 1990.

The new class should also have a constructor which _calls the constructor from the parent class `GameWarehouse`_. The constructor takes no arguments.

You may use the following code to test your implementation:

```python
museum = GameMuseum()
museum.add_game(ComputerGame("Pacman", "Namco", 1980))
museum.add_game(ComputerGame("GTA 2", "Rockstar", 1999))
museum.add_game(ComputerGame("Bubble Bobble", "Taito", 1986))
for game in museum.list_games():
    print(game.name)
```

<sample-output>

Pacman
Bubble Bobble

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

<programming-exercise name='Areas' tmcname='part10-03_areas'>

The exercise template contains a class definition for a `Rectangle`. It represents a [rectangle shape](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rectangle). A Rectangle works like this:

```python
rectangle = Rectangle(2, 3)
print(rectangle)
print("area:", rectangle.area())
```

<sample-output>

rectangle 2x3
area: 6

</sample-output>

## Square

Please define a class named `Square` which inherits the `Rectangle` class. The sides of a [square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square) are all of equal length, which makes the square a special case of the rectangle. The new class should not contain any new attributes.

A Square object is used as follows:

```python
square = Square(4)
print(square)
print("area:", square.area())
```

<sample-output>

square 4x4
area: 16

</sample-output>

</programming-exercise>

<programming-exercise name='Word game' tmcname='part10-04_word_game'>

The exercise template contains the class definition for a `WordGame`. It provides some basic functionality for playing different word-based games:

```python
import random

class WordGame():
    def __init__(self, rounds: int):
        self.wins1 = 0
        self.wins2 = 0
        self.rounds = rounds

    def round_winner(self, player1_word: str, player2_word: str):
        # determine a random winner
        return random.randint(1, 2)

    def play(self):
        print("Word game:")
        for i in range(1, self.rounds+1):
            print(f"round {i}")
            answer1 = input("player1: ")
            answer2 = input("player2: ")

            if self.round_winner(answer1, answer2) == 1:
                self.wins1 += 1
                print("player 1 won")
            elif self.round_winner(answer1, answer2) == 2:
                self.wins2 += 1
                print("player 2 won")
            else:
                pass # it's a tie

        print("game over, wins:")
        print(f"player 1: {self.wins1}")
        print(f"player 2: {self.wins2}")
```

The game is played as follows:

```python
p = WordGame(3)
p.play()
```

<sample-output>

Word game:
round 1
player1: **longword**
player2: **??**
player 2 won
round 2
player1: **i'm the best**
player2: **wut?**
player 1 won
round 3
player1: **who's gonna win**
player2: **me**
player 1 won
game over, wins:
player 1: 2
player 2: 1

</sample-output>

In this "basic" version of the game the winner is determined randomly. The input from the players has no effect on the result.

## Longest word wins

Please define a class named `LongestWord`. It is a version of the game where whoever types in the longest word on each round wins.

The new version of the game is implemented by _inheriting_ the `WordGame` class. The `round_winner` method should also be suitably overridden. The outline of the new class is as follows:

```python
class LongestWord(WordGame):
    def __init__(self, rounds: int):
        super().__init__(rounds)

    def round_winner(self, player1_word: str, player2_word: str):
        # your code for determining the winner goes here
```

An example of how the new game is played:

```python
p = LongestWord(3)
p.play()
```

<sample-output>

Word game:
round 1
player1: **short**
player2: **longword**
player 2 won
round 2
player1: **word**
player2: **wut?**
round 3
player1: **i'm the best**
player2: **no, me**
player 1 won
game over, wins:
player 1: 1
player 2: 1

</sample-output>

## Most vowels wins

Please define another WordGame class named `MostVowels`. In this version of the game whoever has squeezed more vowels into their word wins the round.

## Rock paper scissors

Finally, please define a class named `RockPaperScissors` which allows you to play a game of [rock paper scissors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_paper_scissors).

The rules of the game are as follows:

- rock beats scissors (the rock can break the scissors but the scissors can't cut the rock)
- paper beats rock (the paper can cover the rock)
- scissors beats paper (the scissors can cut the paper)

If the input from either player is invalid, they lose the round. If both players type in something else than _rock_, _paper_ or _scissors_, the result is a tie.

An example of how the game is played:

```python
p = RockPaperScissors(4)
p.play()
```

<sample-output>

Word game:
round 1
player1: **rock**
player2: **rock**
round 2
player1: **rock**
player2: **paper**
player 2 won
round 3
player1: **scissors**
player2: **paper**
player 1 won
round 4
player1: **paper**
player2: **dynamite**
player 1 won
game over, wins:
player 1: 2
player 2: 1

</sample-output>
