We have already come across situations where we're dealing with a series of items, and we'd need the next item(s) in the series, but we wouldn't necessarily want to formulate the entire series up to that point each time a new item is required. Some recursive series, such as the Fibonacci number, are a good example of such a situation. If each function call recursively generates the entire series up to the desired point, we end up generating the beginning of the series many times over.

Python _generators_ are a way of producing just the next item in a series when it is needed, essentially running the generation process for the series only once (for a given execution of a program). They work mostly like normal functions, as they can be called and will return values, but the value a generator function returns differs from a normal function. A normal function should return the same value every time, given the same arguments. A generator function, on the other hand, should remember its current state and return the next item in the series, which may be different from the previous item.

Just as there are many ways of solving most any programming problem, there are many ways of achieving a functionality similar to generators, but generators can help make the program easier to understand, and can in certain situations save memory or other computational resources.

## The keyword yield

A generator function must contain the keyword `yield`, which marks out the value which the function returns. Let's take a look at a function which generates integer numbers, starting from zero and ending at a pre-determined maximum value:

```python

def counter(max_value: int):
    number = 0
    while number <= max_value:
        yield number
        number += 1

```

Now the `counter` function can be passed as an argument to the function `next()`:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = counter(10)
    print("First value:")
    print(next(numbers))
    print("Second value:")
    print(next(numbers))
```

<sample-output>

First value:
0
Second value:
1

</sample-output>

As you can see from the example above, the keyword `yield` is similar to the keyword `return`: both are used to define a return value. The difference is that `yield` doesn't "close" the function in the same sense as `return`. A generator function with the `yield` keyword keeps track of its state, and the next time it is called, it will continue from the same state.

This generator also requires a maximum value, which was `10` in the example above. When the generator runs out of values, it will raise a `StopIteration` exception:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # creates a generator with maximum value 1
    numbers = counter(1)
    print(next(numbers))
    print(next(numbers))
    print(next(numbers))
```

<sample-output>

0
1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "generator_example.py", line 11, in <module>
    print(next(numbers))
StopIteration

</sample-output>

The exception can be caught with a `try` - `except` block:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = counter(1)
    try:
        print(next(numbers))
        print(next(numbers))
        print(next(numbers))
    except StopIteration:
        print("ran out of numbers")
```

<sample-output>

0
1
ran out of numbers

</sample-output>

Traversing through all the items in a generator is easily done with a `for` loop:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    numbers = counter(5)
    for number in numbers:
        print(number)
```

<sample-output>

0
1
2
3
4
5

</sample-output>

Generators do not have to have a defined maximum value or termination point. They can generate values infinitely (within other computational and physical constraints, naturally). 

Pay mind, though: traversing a generator with a `for` loop only works if the generator terminates at some point. If the generator is built on an infinite loop, trying to traverse it with a simple `for` loop will cause an endless execution, just like a `while` loop with no end or break condition would.

<programming-exercise name='Even numbers' tmcname='part12-08_even_numbers'>

Please write a generator function named `even_numbers(beginning: int, maximum: int)` which takes two integers as its arguments. The function should produce even numbers starting from `beginning` and ending with, at most, `maximum`.

Two examples of how the function works:

```python
numbers = even_numbers(2, 10)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

<sample-output>

2
4
6
8
10

</sample-output>

```python
numbers = even_numbers(11, 21)
for number in numbers:
    print(number)
```

<sample-output>

12
14
16
18
20

</sample-output>

<programming-exercise name='Prime numbers' tmcname='part12-09_prime_numbers'>

A prime number is a number which is divisible only by itself and the number 1. By convention prime numbers are defined as positive integers from the number 2 upwards. The first six prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, 11 and 13.

Please write a generator function `prime_numbers()` which creates a new generator. The generator should return new prime numbers, one by one in sequence, from 2 onwards. NB: this generator never terminates. It will generate numbers for as long as they are needed.

For example:

```python
numbers = prime_numbers()
for i in range(8):
    print(next(numbers))
```

<sample-output>

2
3
5
7
11
13
17
19

</sample-output>

**Hint:** you can use a loop to check if a number is a prime number. If we are checking the number `x`, the loop would go through the numbers `2` to `x-1`. If `x` is divisible by any one of these, it is not a prime number.

</programming-exercise>


## Generator comprehensions

You do not necessarily need a function definition to create a generator. We can use a structure similar to a list comprehension instead. This time we use _round_ brackets to signify a generator instead of a list or a dictionary:

```python
# This generator returns squares of integers
squares = (x ** 2 for x in range(1, 64))

print(squares) # the printout of a generator object isn't too informative

for i in range(5):
    print(next(squares))
```

<sample-output>

<generator object &lt;genexpr&gt; at 0x000002B4224EBFC0>
1
4
9
16
25

</sample-output>

In the following example we print out substrings of the English alphabet, each three characters long. This prints out the first 10 items in the generator:

```python
substrings = ("abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"[i : i + 3] for i in range(24))

# print out first 10 substrings
for i in range(10):
    print(next(substrings))
```

<sample-output>

abc
bcd
cde
def
efg
fgh
ghi
hij
ijk
jkl

</sample-output>

<programming-exercise name='Random words' tmcname='part12-10_random_words'>

Please write a function named `word_generator(characters: str, length: int, amount: int)` which returns a new generator for generating random words based on the parameters given.

A random word is generated by selecting from the string named `characters` as many characters as indicated by the argument `length`. The same character can appear many times in a random word.

The generator returns as many words as specified by the argument `amount` before terminating.

An example run of the word generator:

```python
wordgen = word_generator("abcdefg", 3, 5)
for word in wordgen:
    print(word)
```

<sample-output>

dbf
baf
ead
fga
ccc

</sample-output>

NB: it is up to you how you implement this function. You may use a "traditional" generator or a generator comprehension equally well.
